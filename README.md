# Extended Kaplan Algorithm
### The Extended Kaplan algorithm enhances the original Kaplan approach by incorporating nonlinear motion models for improved tracking of highly maneuvering targets. It extends the variable-structure interacting multiple model (VS-IMM) framework with adaptive state estimation techniques to handle abrupt trajectory changes. This results in better accuracy and robustness in complex tracking scenarios.

# Spline Algorithm 
### A spline is a mathematical function used to create smooth curves by connecting a series of points with piecewise polynomials. It ensures continuity and smooth transitions between segments, reducing abrupt changes in direction. Common types include B-splines and cubic splines, widely used in computer graphics, data interpolation, and path optimization.


# Pure Pursuit Algorithm
### The Pure Pursuit algorithm is a path-tracking method used in robotics and autonomous vehicles to follow a predefined trajectory. It calculates a target point along the path and generates steering commands to minimize the distance between the vehicle and the target. This approach ensures smooth path-following but may struggle with sharp turns at high speeds.
